2023 has been a year of travel, of slow-burn progress, and of unexpected events.

I flew a lot. Amsterdam, Val Thorens, Vietnam. Many fun experiences were had.

Career-wise, it has been quite unremarkable. The year seems to have flown by in a slow-burn fashion. A lot more focus will be required to speed up the situation.

The December sickness certainly left a mark on me. What started out as an innocent family visit turned into a high fever and a sequence of unfortunate things. I am still recovering from the aftermath. There will be a lot of things I need to be do in 2024 to remedy the situation.

My focus in 2024 will be:

- Health: running, swimming, and climbing. Also eating lots of fiber, as well as drinking water.
- Relationships: nurture existing and expand new horizons.
- Career: focus and find product-market fit
- Fun: drawing, writing, reading, and making music

The first few months will be spent recovering, but after that will be a time of focus and execution. I wish for a happy and prosperous 2024!
