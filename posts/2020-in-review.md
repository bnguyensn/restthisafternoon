2020 will be over tomorrow! What a strange and wild trip it has been this year. It goes without saying that no matter how hard you prepare, life can always hit you with something unexpected.

A few things I've done this year:

- Shipped some code at work (non-public project)
- Shipped some code for our side hustle [Build to Rent](https://buildtorent.io)
- Started [my own place](https://restthisafternoon.com) on the Internet

A few things I missed out due to the worldwide pandemic:

- A ski trip in March
- Lots of pub drinks
- Annual family visit

A few things I aim to achieve next year:

- Ship more code for our side hustle [Build to Rent](https://buildtorent.io)
- Get out of the rat race

There is a saying, the days are long, but the years are short. It felt like just yesterday that I was home with the family at the beginning of the year, and now here we are, on the verge of the new year.

Stay true to yourself, be thankful for life, and let's go face 2021 ðŸŽ†!
