2021 will be over tomorrow! I learned and created a lot of new things this year. So despite the pandemic, 

A few things I've done this year:

- Shipped lots of code for our side hustle [Build to Rent](https://buildtorent.io)
   - Additional core functions surrounding data analytics started to being built
   - New designs were implemented
   - Tenants started using the site mid-way through the year
   - Real, actual customers started to reach out
   - Personnel changes happened, but we've arrived at a good spot for the next year
- Left the workplace college that is PwC and shipped code at the new workplace (not-yet-public project)
- Maintained bouldering (started around September 2020). I'm around V3-ish, I think.
- Visited Cornwall
- Watched lots of IMAX (a few twice: Shang-Chi, Eternals, Spider-Man: No Way Home)
- Watched England went (almost) all the way at the EURO.
- Made new friends and connections

My GitHub contributions this year:

A few things I missed out due to the worldwide pandemic:

- Visiting my family in Vietnam
- A few drinks here and there (but much better than 2020)

A few things I aim to achieve next year:

- Having income from the side hustle [Build to Rent](https://buildtorent.io) (and with that, corporate freedom)
- Visiting my family in Vietnam
- Bouldering: get to V5
- Maintaining exercises and running (during the summer)
- Keep watching lots of IMAX
- Keep making new friends and connections
- Driving license (low priority)

Ending this note, I watched [Don't Look Up](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/) (with Leonardo DiCaprio) near the end of the year. The movie has a good but scary message on climate change. What hits me, is at the end of the movie, Leo's character says to his family and friends: _"We really did have everything, didn't we"_.

A short, but simple message. You don't really appreciate the things you have until it's gone.

I'd like to keep that as a reminder, to keep working on important things, to not lose sight of my North Star, and to be thankful always of the things I have.

Here's to an awesome 2022 ðŸŽ†!
