I created my GitHub Pages page [here](https://bnguyensn.github.io).

It is a basic HTML page. It doesn't do anything special but display text information.

The purpose of the page is a reminder for myself of the internet's core value: a bunch of information linked together.

A simple concept, yet incredibly powerful. The internet had a similar impact to the invention of writing in the sense that it "levelled up" humanity's learning rate. Information went from being unrecorded, to being recorded and passed down through generations, to being readily available and accessible to almost everyone. There was an exponential expansion of knowledge, and boy did humanity seize on that opportunity.

What will the next big jump be? How can learning rate be advanced even further? We can certainly consider the possibility of directly "beaming" information to a person's brain, cutting out all the current boring typings and searching processes. May there will be an AI that automatically reads our thoughts and instantly provides answers after querying its central knowledge net?

Whatever the future will be, I am excited for it.
